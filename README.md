### Problem Statement

With resources for mental health being so limited in the US, and culture suppressing those who need help from seeking it, it would be immensely valuable to provide a model which could predict whether an individual was suffering from various mental health issues using sentiment analysis as a backbone for classification. We'll use Recall/Sensitivity as our main metric since False Positives would suggest people get help when they may not necessarily need (but everyone needs it) vs a false negative that could minimize serious health issues. We'll set our target at least 95% recall before production-ready.
