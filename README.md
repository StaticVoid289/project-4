# Project 4 - Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health

## Introduction

In recent years, the intersection of data science and mental health has emerged as a powerful space for innovation, particularly with the growing availability of natural language data. From social media posts to clinical transcripts, the language people use can offer deep insights into their emotional well-being, cognitive states, and potential mental health conditions. Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables researchers and practitioners to systematically analyze these text-based signals at scale, uncovering patterns that may not be immediately evident to human observers.

This project explores the use of NLP techniques for mental health analysis using a composite dataset curated from multiple sources available on Kaggle. The dataset integrates user-generated content, survey responses, and annotated mental health indicators to form a rich foundation for multi-faceted analysis. By combining diverse data types and origins, the project aims to evaluate how effectively machine learning models can identify signs of depression, anxiety, stress, and other mental health concerns through linguistic features.

The goals of this exploration include preprocessing and unifying heterogeneous text data, applying modern NLP techniques (such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and transformer-based embeddings), and training classifiers to predict mental health status. Ultimately, this work aims to contribute to the growing body of research on how data-driven tools can support early detection and intervention in mental health care, while also surfacing ethical considerations around privacy, bias, and the responsible use of AI in sensitive domains.

## Techniques Used

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
- **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF, sentiment scores, linguistic metrics
- **Modeling**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Fine-tuned BERT (Transformers)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Recall

## Data Source

[Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health)

The dataset integrates information from the following Kaggle datasets:

- 3k Conversations Dataset for Chatbot
- Depression Reddit Cleaned
- Human Stress Prediction
- Predicting Anxiety in Mental Health Data
- Mental Health Dataset Bipolar
- Reddit Mental Health Data
- Students Anxiety and Depression Dataset
- Suicidal Mental Health Dataset
- Suicidal Tweet Detection Dataset

Note: Data used in this project is anonymized and publicly shared for research purposes.

## Ethical Considerations

This project emphasizes the ethical responsibility involved in working with mental health data:
- No attempts are made to diagnose individuals.
- Models are not intended for clinical deployment.
- Biases in the data and predictions are acknowledged and explored.
- Respect for user privacy and consent is maintained by working only with openly shared datasets.

## Future Work

- Expand dataset with multilingual or real-time data.
- Expand prediction capability with more than just binary classification
- Collaborate with mental health professionals for validation.
- Build a dashboard or visualization interface for non-technical users.
